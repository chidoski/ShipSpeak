## üîí CRITICAL PREVENTION RULES - READ FIRST

**‚ö†Ô∏è USER INSTRUCTION TO CLAUDE: "STOP - Only work within the ShipSpeak project directory. NEVER touch anything outside of /01-web-applications/shipspeak/. All my other projects (bravax, dream-planner, insidertrade, ai-projects) are off-limits." ‚ö†Ô∏è**

### Critical Rules:
1. **NEVER** run `git add .` from portfolio root - Only add specific files
2. **ALWAYS** work inside `/01-web-applications/shipspeak/shipspeak/` directory only
3. **NEVER** delete or move entire project directories
4. **ASK** before any git operations that could affect multiple projects

## Project Overview

ShipSpeak is an AI-powered platform that integrates product sense development with executive communication training. The platform creates a complete learning loop where meeting analysis identifies weakness areas and automatically generates personalized practice modules for product managers and leaders.

### Core Value Proposition
- **Meeting Intelligence**: Real-time analysis of communication patterns in actual meetings
- **Personalized Practice**: Auto-generated modules targeting specific weak areas
- **Product Sense Development**: Real company case studies and decision-making practice
- **Integrated Learning Loop**: Meeting analysis ‚Üí Practice modules ‚Üí Skill improvement ‚Üí Better meetings

## CRITICAL: Development Scope Prevention Rules

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY BOUNDARIES FOR CLAUDE CODE ASSISTANT ‚ö†Ô∏è**

### Working Directory Rules
1. **ALWAYS work within the ShipSpeak directory only**: `/01-web-applications/shipspeak/`
2. **NEVER run git commands from parent directories** - Only from within the ShipSpeak project directory
3. **Always use `cd` to navigate to ShipSpeak directory before ANY git operations**

### Required Commands Before Git Operations
```bash
# ALWAYS run this sequence before any git operations:
cd /Volumes/Extreme\ Pro/Programming/Python/Portfolio-Projects/01-web-applications/shipspeak/
pwd  # Verify correct directory
git status  # Verify only ShipSpeak files are affected
```

**These rules are mandatory and non-negotiable to protect the user's portfolio integrity.**
