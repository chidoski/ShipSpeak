## ‚ùì CRITICAL FRONTEND OPEN QUESTIONS

### Epic 3 Frontend Decisions Needed
- [ ] **Framework Architecture Decision**
  - Should we use Next.js App Router or Pages Router for the company rubric features?
  - How do we handle client-side state for complex company comparisons and filtering?
  - Do we need a global state management solution (Zustand, Redux, or React Context)?

- [ ] **Company Data Strategy**
  - How do we handle real-time updates for company readiness scores (WebSocket vs polling)?
  - Should company rubric data be cached client-side or server-side rendered?
  - How do we optimize for mobile when displaying complex company comparison charts?

- [ ] **User Experience Flows**
  - Should users select target companies during onboarding or after first practice session?
  - How many companies should users be able to track simultaneously (3, 5, unlimited)?
  - Should company readiness be the primary dashboard or secondary to practice sessions?

- [ ] **Data Visualization Requirements**
  - Which charting library for company readiness visualizations (D3, Chart.js, Recharts)?
  - How detailed should skill gap breakdowns be (high-level vs granular criteria)?
  - Should we show confidence scores for rubric accuracy to users or keep internal?

- [ ] **Integration Timeline**
  - Should company rubric UI be built in Epic 3 as placeholders or wait for Epic 6 backend?
  - How do we phase the rollout (company profiles first, then readiness scoring)?
  - Should community validation features be built with the initial company system?

### Design System Questions
- [ ] **Component Architecture**
  - How do we design reusable components for company-specific content?
  - Should company branding (colors, logos) be integrated into the UI?
  - How do we handle accessibility for complex data visualizations?

- [ ] **Mobile Considerations**
  - How do company comparison features work on mobile devices?
  - Should mobile focus on single-company view rather than multi-company comparisons?
  - What's the mobile priority order for company features?
