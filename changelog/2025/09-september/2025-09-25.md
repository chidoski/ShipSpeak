# Changelog - September 25, 2025

## Summary
Project initiation day! Created comprehensive project documentation including PRD, technical architecture, user stories, and development guidelines. Established the foundation for ShipSpeak development with TDD practices and complete project structure.

## Changes Made

### üìù DOCUMENTATION
**Project Requirements Document (PRD)**
- Created comprehensive PRD with market analysis integration
- Defined user personas based on research data
- Documented core features: Meeting Intelligence, Voice Coach, Sense Labs, Real Work Integration
- Established success metrics and KPIs
- **Tests**: N/A (documentation)
- **Time**: 2.5 hours

**Technical Architecture Documentation**
- Designed microservices architecture with Node.js + TypeScript stack
- Selected OpenAI Whisper over Azure Speech for vendor independence
- Created database schema with PostgreSQL and Redis caching
- Defined API structure with GraphQL + REST hybrid approach
- **Tests**: N/A (architecture documentation)
- **Time**: 3 hours

**User Stories Breakdown**
- Converted PRD into 24 detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
- Organized by priority (P0-P3) and development phases
- Integrated learning loop concept: Meeting Analysis ‚Üí Practice Modules ‚Üí Improvement
- Story point estimation: 68 points for MVP, 173 total
- **Tests**: N/A (product planning)
- **Time**: 2 hours

**Development Guidelines (CLAUDE.md)**
- Comprehensive development guide with TDD framework
- Git best practices with commit message standards
- Code style conventions and architecture patterns
- Build commands and deployment procedures
- **Tests**: N/A (development guidelines)
- **Time**: 2.5 hours

### üîß PROJECT SETUP
**Directory Structure**
- Created monorepo structure with apps/ and packages/
- Set up documentation hierarchy in docs/
- Organized by product/, technical/, and deployment/
- **Tests**: N/A (project structure)
- **Time**: 0.5 hours

**Changelog System**
- Created comprehensive changelog directory structure
- Built templates for daily logs, features, and bug fixes
- Established categorization system with emoji labels
- Integration with TDD workflow documentation
- **Tests**: N/A (process documentation)
- **Time**: 1.5 hours

## TDD Notes
### Foundation Phase
- Established TDD as core development methodology
- Created testing stack: Jest + Supertest + Playwright
- Defined Red-Green-Refactor workflow with examples
- Set up testing conventions and file organization

### Documentation-Driven Development
- Used documentation as "specification tests" for the project
- Each document serves as acceptance criteria for implementation
- Clear success criteria established before any coding begins

## Tomorrow's Focus
- [ ] Set up initial project structure with package.json and dependencies
- [ ] Initialize database with PostgreSQL and Redis
- [ ] Create basic Express.js API structure following architecture
- [ ] Begin US001: User Registration with TDD approach
- [ ] Set up testing infrastructure (Jest configuration)

## Challenges & Solutions
**Challenge**: Integrating meeting analysis with personalized practice modules
**Solution**: Redesigned MVP to include both meeting intelligence AND practice generation as core loop
**Learning**: The meeting analysis is only valuable if it creates actionable practice opportunities

**Challenge**: Balancing comprehensive documentation with development speed
**Solution**: Created templates and structured approach to make documentation efficient and reusable
**Learning**: Upfront documentation investment pays off in clearer development direction

## Performance Notes
- Documentation creation: Efficient template-based approach
- User story breakdown: Systematic analysis of PRD requirements
- Architecture decisions: Research-informed technology selections

## Code Review Notes
- Files changed: 8 documentation files created
- Lines added: ~3,000 lines of comprehensive documentation
- Pull request: N/A (initial setup)
- Ready for: Development team onboarding and implementation start

## Notes
- All documentation follows consistent formatting standards
- Integration points clearly defined between components
- Security and privacy considerations documented throughout
- TDD methodology embedded in all development processes
- Vendor independence prioritized (no Microsoft dependencies)
