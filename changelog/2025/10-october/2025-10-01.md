- Following successful industry patterns (Otter.ai)

### Meeting Intelligence Naming
- Professional and enterprise-ready
- Clear functionality indication
- Avoids surveillance connotations
- Industry-standard terminology

## Tomorrow's Focus
- [ ] Begin technical implementation setup
- [ ] Initialize monorepo structure
- [ ] Setup development environment
- [ ] Create initial database schema
- [ ] Start Chrome extension architecture

## Challenges & Solutions
**Challenge**: Meeting capture across all platforms
**Solution**: Hybrid approach with extension + desktop app + bots
**Learning**: Can't capture everything from browser alone

**Challenge**: Making content relevant, not generic
**Solution**: All practice uses actual meeting content
**Learning**: Content is fuel for engine, not curriculum

## Performance Notes

- Key decisions: Meeting Intelligence naming, hybrid capture, PO persona
- Ready for: Development sprint to begin

## Notes
- PO‚ÜíPM persona may be best early adopter segment
- Hybrid capture more complex but necessary
- Content strategy clearly differentiated from courses
- Development checklist prioritizes speed to market
- All documentation now cohesive and aligned
