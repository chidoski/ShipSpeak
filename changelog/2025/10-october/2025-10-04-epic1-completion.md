- **Cost optimization persistence**: Track 75% cost reduction achievements
- **Analysis metadata**: Comprehensive storage of sampling results
- **Performance metrics**: Detailed cost and time tracking

#### 3. File Upload ↔ Smart Sampling Workflow
- **End-to-end orchestration**: Complete pipeline from upload to scenario generation
- **Error handling & retry logic**: Production-ready resilience patterns
- **Data consistency**: Orphaned upload detection and cleanup
- **Security integration**: File validation and consent management

## 🚀 Production Features

### Security & Compliance
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies for all database tables
- **File security scanning** before upload processing
- **Consent management** for meeting recordings
- **Access control** based on user authentication

### Performance & Reliability
- **Smart chunk optimization** for cost-effective processing

---

## 🎓 Key Learning & Technical Decisions

### Database Design Decisions
- **Chose Supabase over raw PostgreSQL** for built-in authentication and real-time features
- **Implemented RLS policies** for security without application-layer complexity
- **Used JSON fields** for flexible scenario context data while maintaining type safety
- **Created composite indexes** for efficient query performance

### Service Integration Patterns
- **Extension pattern** to maintain backwards compatibility with existing services
- **Factory pattern** for service instantiation with dependency injection
- **Orchestrator pattern** for complex multi-service workflows
- **Observer pattern** for real-time progress updates

### Testing Strategy
- **Integration tests first** to ensure service boundaries work correctly
- **Mock external dependencies** to avoid API costs during testing
- **Test data factories** for consistent test scenarios
- **End-to-end workflow testing** to verify complete user journeys

## 📊 Cost & Performance Impact

### Smart Sampling Integration
- **Maintained 75% cost reduction** (from $0.42 to $0.10 per 30-min meeting)
- **Real-time cost tracking** stored in database for optimization
- **Performance metrics** captured for continuous improvement

### Database Performance
- **Query optimization** with strategic indexing
- **Connection pooling** for efficient resource usage
- **Batch operations** for bulk scenario generation
- **Caching strategies** for frequently accessed data
