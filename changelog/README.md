## Daily Changelog Guidelines

### File Naming Convention
- Use ISO date format: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Example: `2025-01-15.md` for January 15th, 2025

### Entry Categories
Each daily log should categorize changes using these labels:

**🆕 FEATURES** - New functionality or capabilities
**🐛 BUGFIXES** - Bug fixes and issue resolutions  
**⚡ IMPROVEMENTS** - Performance improvements and optimizations
**🔧 REFACTOR** - Code refactoring without functional changes
**📝 DOCUMENTATION** - Documentation updates and additions
**🧪 TESTING** - Test additions, modifications, or fixes
**🔒 SECURITY** - Security-related changes
**🎨 UI/UX** - User interface and user experience improvements
**🚀 DEPLOYMENT** - Infrastructure and deployment changes
**📦 DEPENDENCIES** - Package updates and dependency changes

### Entry Format
Each entry should include:
- **Category** (using emoji labels above)
- **User Story Reference** (if applicable, e.g., US001)
- **Brief Description** (one-line summary)
- **Technical Details** (implementation specifics)
- **Testing Notes** (TDD tests added/modified)
- **Time Spent** (optional, for tracking)

### Example Daily Entry Structure
```markdown
# Changelog - January 15, 2025

```

## Quick Start

### Creating a New Daily Entry
1. Navigate to the appropriate month folder (create if doesn't exist)
2. Copy the daily template: `cp templates/daily-log-template.md 2025/01-january/2025-01-15.md`
3. Fill in your changes throughout the day
4. Commit the changelog with your code changes

### Using Templates
Templates are provided for common entry types:
- `daily-log-template.md` - Complete daily log structure
- `feature-template.md` - Detailed feature implementation notes
- `bugfix-template.md` - Bug fix documentation with root cause analysis

### Integration with Git Workflow
- Include changelog updates in feature branch commits
- Reference changelog entries in pull requests
- Use changelog for release notes and version documentation

## Best Practices

### During Development
- **Update in real-time**: Add entries as you work, don't wait until end of day
- **Be specific**: Include technical details, not just "fixed bug"
- **Link to code**: Reference specific files, functions, or commits when helpful
- **Track time**: Optional but useful for productivity insights

### Quality Standards
- **Consistent formatting**: Use the established templates and emoji categories
- **Clear language**: Write for future you and team members
- **Complete context**: Include enough detail to understand the change later
- **Link related work**: Reference user stories, issues, or related changes

### Review Process
- **Daily review**: End each day by reviewing and organizing your changelog entry
- **Weekly summary**: Create brief weekly summaries for broader perspective
- **Monthly cleanup**: Archive completed months and update main CHANGELOG.md

## Automation Opportunities

### Future Enhancements
- **Git hook integration**: Automatically prompt for changelog updates on commit
- **Template automation**: Script to create daily entry with pre-filled date
- **Summary generation**: Aggregate daily entries into weekly/monthly summaries
- **Release notes**: Auto-generate release notes from changelog entries

### Useful Commands
```bash
# Create new daily entry
cp changelog/templates/daily-log-template.md changelog/2025/$(date +%m-%B)/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md

# View today's changes (if entry exists)
cat changelog/2025/$(date +%m-%B)/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md

# Create monthly directory
mkdir -p changelog/2025/$(date +%m-%B)
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### TDD Integration
Since we use Test-Driven Development, changelog entries should reflect the TDD cycle:
```markdown
### 🧪 TESTING
**Red Phase**: Added failing test for user email validation
- Test expects validation error for invalid email formats
- Verified test fails as expected

**Green Phase**: Implemented minimal email validation
- Added regex pattern for basic email validation  
- Test now passes with minimal implementation

**Refactor Phase**: Enhanced validation with comprehensive rules
- Added proper email format validation library
- Improved error messages and validation feedback
- All tests still pass with improved implementation
```

### User Story Tracking
Link changelog entries to user stories from the product backlog:
```markdown
### 🆕 FEATURES
**US003: Meeting Audio Recording and Analysis**
- Implemented WebRTC audio capture for browser extension
- Added real-time audio streaming to analysis service
- Created audio processing pipeline with Whisper integration
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ✅ 8/9 criteria completed (1 pending: error handling)
```

This changelog system will help you maintain detailed records of your daily progress, making it easier to track development velocity, identify patterns, and maintain project history.
