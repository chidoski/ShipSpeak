## Key Terminology

### Core Components
- **Meeting Intelligence**: System that captures and analyzes real meetings
- **Adaptive Modules**: Auto-generated practice exercises from actual meeting content
- **Generic Modules**: Always-available baseline practice drills
- **Standards Modules**: Company framework exercises (Amazon LPs, Meta principles)
- **Art of the Sale**: Internal/external influence training with simulation agents
- **Voice Coach**: AI analysis of executive communication patterns
- **Sense Labs**: Real product decision practice with actual company cases

### Technical Terms
- **Hybrid Capture**: Chrome extension (40%), Desktop app (60%), Meeting bots (enterprise)
- **Smart Sampling**: Cost-optimized meeting analysis with 75% cost reduction
- **Diarization**: Speaker isolation in multi-person calls
- **Prosody Analysis**: Tone, pitch, pace evaluation
- **Stackable Cards**: UI pattern for module delivery
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Foundation â†’ Practice â†’ Mastery skill adaptation

## Key User Personas

1. **Sarah Chen** - Senior PM â†’ Director/VP (Executive presence, C-suite meetings)
2. **Marcus Rodriguez** - IC â†’ Staff/Principal PM (Strategic narrative, influence skills)
3. **Alex Martinez** - PO â†’ PM Transition (Strategic thinking, business vocabulary)
4. **Jennifer Kim** - New PM Leader (Altitude control, board presentations)
5. **David Thompson** - Engineer â†’ PM (PM vocabulary, customer focus)

## Content Philosophy

### Content Powers the Engine
- Content is NOT courses or lessons - Content IS practice templates and evaluation rubrics
- Everything uses the user's ACTUAL work content
- Frameworks provide structure, not theory

### Example Flow
1. Meeting detects: "User buried recommendation"
2. System generates: Practice with THEIR recommendation  
3. User practices: 30-second answer-first with their data
4. Feedback: Specific to their content and context

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Coverage Strategy
- **Google Meet**: Chrome extension (100% coverage)
- **Zoom Desktop**: Desktop app required (Electron)
- **Teams**: Desktop app or bot framework
- **Fallback**: Manual upload always available

### Privacy First
- Consent required for all recording
- Zero-knowledge processing
- No raw audio storage
- User controls all data retention

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### When Writing Code
- Don't assume platform coverage (check capture method)
- Don't store sensitive meeting content
- Don't create generic content (everything should be adaptive)
- Don't forget POâ†’PM specific features

### When Updating Documentation
- Keep "Meeting Intelligence" naming (not Black Box)
- Maintain focus on real work integration
- Remember it's practice, not courses
- Include PO persona considerations

## Communication Guidelines

### When Discussing ShipSpeak
- Emphasize: "Practice with your actual work"
- Avoid: "Learn about frameworks"
- Say: "Adaptive to your meetings"
- Not: "Generic communication training"

### Value Proposition
"ShipSpeak helps PMs sound as smart as they actually are by turning their real meetings into personalized practice."
