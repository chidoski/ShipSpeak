# Project Requirements Document: ShipSpeak
## The Product Leadership Development Platform

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** September 2025  
**Project Codename:** ShipSpeak  

---

## Executive Summary

ShipSpeak represents a fundamental reimagining of product management training, addressing the critical gap between theoretical knowledge and practical capability. The platform uniquely combines product sense development with executive communication training through AI-powered real-world practice, targeting the $56.89 billion professional development market where companies report a 353% ROI on quality training.

### The Opportunity

- **6,000+ open PM roles globally** with salaries ranging from $86K to $232K+
- **90% of PM time involves communication**, yet no existing platform systematically develops executive voice
- **Current solutions are fragmented**: strategy courses separate from communication training
- **AI PM roles command $300K+ salaries** but few platforms prepare professionals for this segment

### Our Solution

ShipSpeak creates an integrated learning environment where product leaders practice real decision-making while simultaneously developing executive communication skills. The platform transforms daily work into deliberate practice through five core pillars:

1. **Voice Coach**: AI analysis of executive communication patterns
2. **Sense Labs**: Real product challenges from actual companies
3. **Art of the Sale**: Internal and external influence training with simulation agents
4. **Meeting Intelligence**: Live meeting capture and adaptive module generation
5. **Real Work Integration**: Practice with actual PRDs, roadmaps, and strategies
