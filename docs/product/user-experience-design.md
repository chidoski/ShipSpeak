## Core UX Principles

### 1. Guided Discovery Over Direct Instruction
- Users discover insights through AI-guided questioning
- Revelations come after user engagement, not before
- Building metacognitive awareness alongside skill development

### 2. Seamless Integration with PM Workflow  
- Minimal friction for meeting upload and analysis
- Practice sessions fit into existing schedules (5-10 min daily)
- Progressive enhancement of natural PM activities

### 3. Visible Progress and Competence Building
- Clear skill progression with measurable improvements
- Celebration of victories and breakthrough moments
- Connection between practice and real-world meeting performance

### 4. Dual-Layer Feedback Loop
- Simultaneous development of communication skills and product sense
- Integrated scoring that reflects real PM leadership capability
- Context-aware suggestions based on user's role and industry

## Primary User Journeys

### Journey 1: First-Time User Onboarding

#### Phase 1: Skill Assessment (Day 1, 15 minutes)
```
1. Welcome & Value Proposition
   "ShipSpeak analyzes your meetings and helps you practice like a pro PM"

2. Role Contextualization
   â€¢ Company stage (Startup, Growth, Enterprise)
   â€¢ PM level (Associate, Senior, Principal)
   â€¢ Industry focus (B2B SaaS, Consumer, Marketplace, etc.)
   â€¢ Current challenges (multiple choice + open text)

3. Baseline Skill Demo
   "Let's see how you'd handle this scenario..."
   [Present 3-minute video scenario: "CEO asks about competitor response"]
   
   User provides response â†’ AI asks follow-up questions:
   "What assumption did you make about the competitor's strategy?"
   "How confident are you in that reasoning?"
   
   Creates initial skill profile without being judgmental.

4. Learning Style Preference
   â€¢ Communication focus vs Product sense focus
   â€¢ Daily challenge timing preference
   â€¢ Practice session length preference (5min, 10min, 15min)
```

#### Phase 2: First Meeting Analysis (Days 2-7)
```
1. Meeting Upload Prompt
   "Ready to analyze your first meeting? Upload any product-related meeting 
   from the past week."
   
   Simple drag-and-drop with progress bar
   Security note: "Your data is encrypted and never shared"

2. Processing Experience
   "Analyzing critical moments... This usually takes 2-3 minutes"
   
   Progress indicators:
   â€¢ Transcription complete
   â€¢ Critical moments identified  
   â€¢ Communication patterns analyzed
   â€¢ Product decisions mapped
   
3. First Socratic Session (10 minutes)
   AI Mentor avatar appears:
   "I found 3 interesting moments. Let's explore minute 8:47 together..."
   
   [Plays 30-second audio clip]
   
   "Before we discuss, what did you notice about the stakeholder's response?"
   
   Conversational interface with text/voice options
   AI adapts based on user's engagement level
```

#### Phase 3: First Practice Module (Day 3-5)
```
1. Personalized Recommendation
   "Based on your meeting, I think you'd benefit from practicing 
   'Handling Skeptical Questions.' Ready for a 5-minute session?"

2. Scenario Setup
   Real context: Similar to user's actual meeting situation
   "You're presenting a new feature proposal to the engineering lead who's 
   concerned about technical debt..."

3. Progressive Practice
   â€¢ Attempt 1: Open response, minimal guidance
   â€¢ AI feedback: "Tell me more about your reasoning..."
   â€¢ Attempt 2: Guided improvement with specific framework
   â€¢ Attempt 3: Mastery demonstration with harder variation

4. Progress Celebration
   "Excellent! You've improved your response structure from 3/10 to 7/10. 
   Ready for tomorrow's daily challenge?"
```

### Journey 2: Daily Active User Flow

#### The Daily Challenge (5-10 minutes, Every Morning)
```
1. Contextual Greeting (8:00 AM notification)
   "Good morning! Today's challenge: Airbnb's 2015 international expansion decision"

2. Historical Scenario Presentation
   Brief context + 90-second audio/video of actual PM discussion
   "The growth team wants to prioritize 5 new countries simultaneously. 
   You have 60 seconds to formulate your response."

3. User Response Collection
   â€¢ Voice recording (preferred)
   â€¢ Text input (alternative)
   â€¢ Structured prompts if user gets stuck

4. Socratic Deep-Dive
   AI Mentor progression:
   "What's your biggest concern with this approach?"
   â†’ "Why do you think that's the highest risk?"
   â†’ "What data would you need to confirm that?"
   â†’ "How would you test that assumption cheaply?"

5. Framework Application
   "You've just applied the 'Risk Laddering' framework! 
   Let's see how this connects to your recent meeting patterns..."

6. Progress Tracking
   Visual skill tree showing communication + product sense growth
   Streak counter and achievement badges
```

#### The Weekly Meeting Analysis Cycle
```
MONDAY: Upload meeting from previous week
   â†’ AI identifies 2-3 critical moments
   â†’ Schedule Socratic session for Tuesday

TUESDAY-THURSDAY: Socratic Discovery Sessions (10 min each)
   â†’ Deep dive on each critical moment
   â†’ User-led pattern identification
   â†’ AI confirmation and expansion
   â†’ Practice module recommendations

FRIDAY: Weekly Progress Review
   â†’ Comparison with previous weeks
   â†’ Skill trajectory visualization
   â†’ Next week's focus area recommendation
   â†’ Optional: Custom scenario generation for weekend practice
```

### Journey 3: Advanced User - Mastery Development

#### Self-Directed Skill Development
```
1. Skill Gap Analysis
   User accesses personal dashboard:
   "Your communication skills are strong (8.2/10) but strategic thinking 
   could improve (6.1/10). Want to focus on systems thinking?"

2. Custom Learning Path Creation
   "I'll generate 10 scenarios over the next 2 weeks focusing on..."
   
   User can modify:
   â€¢ Specific skill focus (market analysis, technical decisions, etc.)
   â€¢ Industry context (their actual industry vs. cross-industry learning)
   â€¢ Stakeholder types (CEO, CTO, customers, board members)
   â€¢ Difficulty progression rate

3. Advanced Practice Modes
   
   A) "Case Study Deep Dive" (30-45 minutes)
      Full product case with multiple decision points
      "You're Spotify's PM in 2017. Podcasts are growing but music is core..."
      
   B) "Scenario Generator" (On-demand)
      "Generate a scenario where I practice handling technical debt conversations 
      with a skeptical CTO at a Series B startup"
      
   C) "Peer Comparison" (Opt-in)
      "See how other Senior PMs handled similar situations"
      Anonymized response patterns and approaches

4. Teaching Mode Unlocked
   "You've mastered 'Data Storytelling.' Ready to teach it back to me?"
   
   User explains framework to AI
   AI asks clarifying questions as "confused junior PM"
   Reinforces mastery through teaching
```

## Interaction Patterns

### The Socratic Conversation Flow

#### Pattern 1: Initial Engagement
```
AI: [Presents situation/clip]
AI: "What stands out to you about this moment?"
User: [Response]
AI: "Tell me more about [specific aspect they mentioned]"
User: [Elaboration]
AI: "That's an interesting perspective. What led you to that conclusion?"
```

#### Pattern 2: Guided Discovery
```
AI: "Let me ask you something different. What do you think the stakeholder 
    was really concerned about?"
User: "Maybe the timeline?"
AI: "Timeline is part of it. Go deeper - what fear might drive that concern?"
User: "Risk of missing the launch window?"
AI: "You're getting warmer. What happens to their team if you miss the window?"
User: "Oh... their team looks bad to their boss?"
AI: "Exactly! Now you're thinking about stakeholder motivations. 
    How does this change your approach?"
```

#### Pattern 3: Framework Introduction
```
AI: "You've naturally discovered what we call the 'Stakeholder Motivation Map.' 
    Want to practice applying it systematically?"
    
[Presents framework visualization]

AI: "Try using this with the next scenario..."
```

### Progress Feedback Patterns

#### Celebration Pattern
```
"ðŸŽ‰ Breakthrough moment! You just demonstrated advanced systems thinking. 
Three weeks ago, you focused on immediate fixes. Today, you identified 
second-order effects. That's VP-level product sense!"
```

#### Growth Edge Pattern
```
"You handled the technical explanation beautifully - clear and concise. 
I noticed you hesitated when they pushed back on timeline. Want to 
explore what made that challenging?"
```

#### Pattern Recognition
```
"This is the third time this month you've excelled when stakeholders 
challenge your data. You've clearly developed your 'Confident Defense' skill. 
Ready to work on proactive data storytelling?"
```
