# ShipSpeak Phase 1 Slice Execution Guide
## How to Implement Each Enhanced Slice

This guide provides the exact commands and workflow for implementing each Phase 1 slice with the comprehensive framework (PM career transitions, industry context, executive PM support, meeting capture, multi-dimensional competency tracking, and smart feedback strategy).

---

## Prerequisites

Before implementing any slice, ensure you have:
1. **ShipSpeak project directory**: `/01-web-applications/shipspeak/`
2. **Implementation prompts**: Available in `/docs/skills/implementation-prompts/`
3. **Phase 1 resource guide**: `/docs/skills/shipspeak-phase-execution/resources/phase1-frontend-foundation.md`

---

## Slice Implementation Workflow

### Step 1: Review Slice Requirements
```bash
# Navigate to ShipSpeak project
cd /Volumes/Extreme\ Pro/Programming/Python/Portfolio-Projects/01-web-applications/shipspeak/

# Read the specific slice requirements
cat docs/skills/shipspeak-phase-execution/resources/phase1-frontend-foundation.md | grep -A 50 "Slice X:"
```

### Step 2: Use Implementation Prompt (When Available)
```bash
# Check if implementation prompt exists for the slice
ls docs/skills/implementation-prompts/phase1-slice1-*

# Read the implementation prompt
cat docs/skills/implementation-prompts/phase1-slice1-X-[name]-prompt.md
```

### Step 3: Implement the Slice
```bash
# Create slice implementation using Claude Code
# Copy the implementation prompt and use it to guide development
```
