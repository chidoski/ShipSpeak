# Phase 1: Frontend Foundation - Resource Guide

## Overview
Phase 1 focuses on building a complete frontend experience with mock data to validate the product concept before backend infrastructure investment. This phase delivers a beta-ready product for user validation while establishing the continuous learning framework that powers ShipSpeak's unique value proposition.

## Core Philosophy
Frontend-first development means the entire user journey exists and feels real, even though powered by mock data. Users should not detect they're interacting with mock data. Every slice must demonstrate ShipSpeak's core innovation: turning real PM work into personalized learning experiences.

- **Competency-Specific Responses**: 150+ feedback templates per competency area with dynamic variable insertion

#### Smart Template System Examples
**Pattern-Based Template**:
```
Pattern: User speaks <20% of meeting time
Template: "In this {meetingType}, you spoke for {speakingTime} which represents {percentage}% of the discussion. For {careerLevel} PMs in {industry}, aim for {targetRange}% to demonstrate {competencyArea} leadership. Try {actionableStep} in your next {meetingContext}."
```

**AI-Enhanced Template**:
```
Pattern: Unique stakeholder dynamics detected
AI Input: Meeting context + stakeholder roles + communication patterns
Template: "Your {specificPattern} with {stakeholderType} shows {competencyInsight}. For {industry} {careerLevel}, consider {aiGeneratedRecommendation} based on {meetingSpecificContext}."
```
