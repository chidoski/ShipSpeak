# Smart Sampling Algorithm for ShipSpeak
## Critical Moment Detection and Cost Optimization

**Version:** 1.0  
**Target:** 70% cost reduction while maintaining >80% analysis quality  
**Status:** In Development  

---

## Overview

The Smart Sampling Algorithm is ShipSpeak's core innovation for reducing AI processing costs while maintaining high-quality meeting analysis. Instead of analyzing entire 30-60 minute recordings, the algorithm intelligently selects the most critical 20-30% of content for deep analysis.

### Key Value Propositions
- **70% Cost Reduction**: From $1.80 to $0.54 for a 30-minute meeting
- **Maintained Quality**: >80% accuracy compared to full analysis
- **Faster Processing**: 3x faster turnaround time
- **Scalable**: Enables cost-effective analysis for all user segments

## Critical Moment Detection

### High-Priority Indicators

**Energy-Based Detection**
- Sudden volume increases (indicating emphasis)
- Speaking pace changes (faster = excitement/stress)
- Silence breaks followed by high energy (indicates importance)

**Content-Based Detection**
- Speaker transitions (new perspectives, handoffs)
- Question-answer sequences (decisions being made)
- Keyword clusters (product, revenue, users, problems, solutions)
- Emotional language (frustrated, excited, concerned)

**Meeting-Specific Patterns**
- First 30 seconds of each speaker (context setting)
- Last 30 seconds before transitions (conclusions)
- Mid-meeting silence breaks (thinking/decision moments)
- Overlapping speech (disagreements, interruptions)

### Detection Algorithms

```typescript
interface CriticalMoment {
  startTime: number
  endTime: number
  energyLevel: number
  confidence: number
  reason: 'HIGH_ENERGY_AND_KEYWORDS' | 'SPEAKER_TRANSITION' | 'POST_SILENCE_HIGH_ENERGY' | 'DECISION_POINT'
  keywords?: string[]
  speakerIds?: string[]
}
```

**Energy Analysis Formula**
```
energyScore = (amplitude * 0.4) + (frequencyVariance * 0.3) + (speechRate * 0.3)
threshold = adaptiveThreshold(meetingAverageEnergy, speakerBaseline)
```

**Keyword Importance Scoring**
```
PM Keywords: product, users, revenue, metrics, roadmap, strategy
Executive Keywords: recommend, decision, approve, budget, timeline
Problem Keywords: issue, problem, blocker, risk, concern, challenge
```

## Intelligent Chunking Strategy

### Chunk Prioritization

**HIGH Priority (Always Analyzed)**
- Critical moments + 15 seconds context each side
- Speaker transitions + 10 seconds context
- Meeting opening (first 2 minutes)
- Meeting closing (last 2 minutes)

**MEDIUM Priority (Analyzed if Budget Allows)**
- High-energy segments without keywords
- Long single-speaker segments (sample middle portions)
- Q&A sequences

**LOW Priority (Usually Skipped)**
- Low-energy background conversation
- Technical setup/logistics discussion
- Repeated information or examples

### Chunk Optimization Algorithm

```typescript
interface AudioChunk {
  startTime: number
  endTime: number
  duration: number
  priority: 'HIGH' | 'MEDIUM' | 'LOW'
  valueScore: number
  contextual: boolean
}

function optimizeChunks(
  audioBuffer: AudioBuffer, 
  criticalMoments: CriticalMoment[], 
  targetSamplingRatio: number
): AudioChunk[]
```

**Sampling Budget Allocation**
- HIGH priority: 60% of analysis budget
- MEDIUM priority: 30% of analysis budget  
- LOW priority: 10% of analysis budget (quality assurance)

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Quality Metrics

**Pattern Detection Accuracy**
- Filler word detection: >85% accuracy vs full analysis
- Confidence issues: >90% accuracy (more critical)
- Structure problems: >80% accuracy
- Key decisions: >95% accuracy (most critical)

**Completeness Validation**
- Speaker representation: All speakers must have ≥2 analyzed segments
- Temporal coverage: No gaps >5 minutes without any analysis
- Context preservation: Critical moments must have sufficient context

### Fallback Mechanisms

**Insufficient Critical Moments**
- If <3 critical moments detected → analyze first/middle/last thirds
- If no speaker transitions → sample every 10 minutes
- If very low energy throughout → full transcription with basic analysis

**Quality Score Too Low**
- If pattern confidence <70% → analyze additional MEDIUM priority chunks
- If speaker coverage insufficient → add speaker-specific segments
- If temporal gaps too large → fill with strategic sampling
