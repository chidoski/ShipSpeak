## Algorithm Architecture Overview

### Three-Layer Approach

**Layer 1: Critical Moment Detection** (Real-time, <1 second)
- Audio energy analysis and speech pattern recognition
- PM-specific keyword and phrase detection
- Speaker transition and interaction pattern analysis
- Decision point and stakeholder pushback identification

**Layer 2: Smart Chunk Selection** (30% sampling ratio)
- Priority-based segment ranking (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Context preservation around critical moments  
- Speaker equity and temporal distribution validation
- Adaptive budget allocation based on content density

**Layer 3: Quality Assurance** (Fallback mechanisms)
- Pattern completeness validation
- Missing context detection and recovery
- Confidence scoring and threshold management
- Progressive fallback to broader sampling if needed

## Communication-First Implementation Strategy

### Core Philosophy
Focus on PM/PO-specific communication patterns that directly impact career advancement and meeting effectiveness, rather than generic speech analysis.

### PM-Specific Detection Patterns

**Executive Communication Markers**
```typescript
const PM_EXECUTIVE_INDICATORS = {
  confidence_patterns: {
    assertive: ['I recommend', 'based on data', 'clear path forward'],
    hedge_words: ['I think maybe', 'probably should', 'perhaps we could'],
    uncertainty: ['not sure if', 'might be worth', 'could potentially']
  },
  
  structure_patterns: {
    answer_first: ['recommendation is', 'bottom line', 'my proposal'],
    build_up: ['let me start with', 'first some context', 'background is'],
    scattered: ['also wanted to mention', 'oh and another thing']
  },
  
  stakeholder_adaptation: {
    technical_audience: ['implementation details', 'technical approach'],
    executive_audience: ['business impact', 'roi', 'strategic value'],
    customer_facing: ['user experience', 'customer pain points']
  }
}
```

**Critical Moment Classification**
1. **Executive Handoffs** (90% priority) - First 60 seconds of PM speaking to leadership
2. **Stakeholder Pushback** (85% priority) - Resistance, concerns, challenge patterns
3. **Decision Articulation** (90% priority) - How recommendations are presented
4. **Influence Attempts** (80% priority) - Persuasion without authority patterns
5. **Framework Application** (75% priority) - Use of PM frameworks in context

### Detection Algorithm Implementation

**Energy-Based Analysis**
```typescript
interface AudioAnalysisResult {
  energyScore: number        // Volume, pitch variation, pace changes
  confidenceLevel: number    // Vocal certainty indicators
  interactionDensity: number // Questions, interruptions, overlaps
  emotionalValence: number   // Stress, excitement, uncertainty detection
}

function calculateCriticalityScore(segment: AudioSegment, pmContext: PMContext): number {
  const energyWeight = 0.3
  const contentWeight = 0.4  
  const contextWeight = 0.3
  
  const energyScore = analyzeAudioFeatures(segment)
  const contentScore = analyzePMLanguagePatterns(segment.transcript)
  const contextScore = analyzeStakeholderInteraction(segment, pmContext)
  
  return (energyScore * energyWeight) + 
         (contentScore * contentWeight) + 
         (contextScore * contextWeight)
}
```

**PM Language Pattern Recognition**
```typescript
class PMCommunicationAnalyzer {
  detectExecutiveLanguage(text: string): PMLanguageScore {
    const assertiveScore = this.countMatches(text, ASSERTIVE_PHRASES) / text.length
    const hedgeWordScore = this.countMatches(text, HEDGE_WORDS) / text.length
    const frameworkUsage = this.detectFrameworkApplication(text)
    
    return {
      executivePresence: assertiveScore - (hedgeWordScore * 2),
      frameworkApplication: frameworkUsage,
      recommendationClarity: this.analyzeRecommendationStructure(text)
    }
  }
  
  detectStakeholderPushback(conversation: ConversationSegment[]): PushbackAnalysis {
    const pushbackIndicators = ['but', 'however', 'concern', 'what about']
    const pmResponses = conversation.filter(seg => seg.speaker === 'PM')
    const stakeholderChallenges = conversation.filter(seg => 
      seg.speaker !== 'PM' && this.containsAny(seg.text, pushbackIndicators)
    )
    
    return {
      challengeCount: stakeholderChallenges.length,
      pmResponseQuality: this.analyzePMResponses(pmResponses),
      influenceEffectiveness: this.measurePersuasionSuccess(conversation)
    }
  }
}
```

## Cost Optimization Implementation

### Unit Economics Model

**Before Smart Sampling** (30-minute meeting)
```
Whisper transcription: 30 min × $0.006/min = $0.18
GPT-4 analysis: ~8000 tokens × $0.03/1K = $0.24
Total: $0.42 per meeting
```

**After Smart Sampling** (30-minute meeting)
```
Whisper transcription: 30 min × $0.006/min = $0.18
Critical moment detection: lightweight ML = $0.005
GPT-4 analysis: ~2400 tokens × $0.03/1K = $0.072
Pattern matching: cached library = $0.005
Total: $0.262 per meeting (38% reduction on processing)

But with smart chunking:
Whisper transcription: 9 min × $0.006/min = $0.054
GPT-4 analysis: ~1200 tokens × $0.03/1K = $0.036
Critical moment detection: $0.005
Pattern matching: $0.005
Total: $0.10 per meeting (76% reduction)
```

### Analysis Budget Allocation Strategy

**High Priority (60% of analysis budget)**
- PM → Executive handoffs (first 60s of PM speaking)
- Stakeholder pushback moments and PM responses
- Decision presentation segments
- Framework application instances
- Meeting opening and closing summaries

**Medium Priority (30% of analysis budget)**  
- Speaker transitions between key stakeholders
- High-energy segments without explicit PM keywords
- Extended Q&A sequences
- Technical deep-dives with PM involvement

**Low Priority (10% of analysis budget)**
- Background conversation and logistics
- Repetitive content or examples
- Non-PM speaker extended monologues
- Administrative and scheduling discussions

### Intelligent Caching Integration

**Pattern Library Caching (Reduces 80% of analysis costs)**
```typescript
class PMPatternLibrary {
  private patterns = {
    // Pre-analyzed common PM communication patterns
    communication_failures: {
      'buried_recommendation': { 
        indicators: ['let me start with context', 'background is'],
        coaching: 'Lead with your recommendation first',
        cost_per_detection: 0.001 // vs $0.01 for fresh analysis
      },
      'hedge_words_executive': {
        indicators: ['I think maybe we should', 'perhaps it might'],
        coaching: 'Use assertive language: "I recommend" not "I think"',
        cost_per_detection: 0.001
      }
    },
    
    stakeholder_patterns: {
      'engineering_pushback': {
        triggers: ['technical complexity', 'implementation challenges'],
        pm_responses: ['data-driven approach', 'phased implementation'],
        cost_per_match: 0.002
      }
    }
  }
  
  analyzeMeetingWithCache(transcript: string, userHistory: PMProfile): PMAnalysis {
    // Check cache for 80% of common patterns (cost: $0.005)
    const cachedInsights = this.matchCachedPatterns(transcript, userHistory)
    
    // Use AI only for novel/complex patterns (cost: $0.02)
    const novelSegments = this.identifyUnmatchedSegments(transcript, cachedInsights)
    const aiAnalysis = this.deepAnalyzeSegments(novelSegments)
    
    return this.combineInsights(cachedInsights, aiAnalysis)
  }
}
```

## Technical Implementation Architecture

### Core Services Integration

**Meeting Analysis Service Pipeline**
```typescript
class SmartSamplingMeetingAnalyzer {
  async analyzeMeeting(audioFile: File, userProfile: PMProfile): Promise<PMAnalysisResult> {
    // Step 1: Full transcription (required baseline)
    const transcript = await this.whisperService.transcribe(audioFile)
    
    // Step 2: Critical moment detection (PM-specific)
    const criticalMoments = await this.detectPMCriticalMoments(transcript, userProfile)
    
    // Step 3: Smart chunk selection (30% sampling)
    const selectedChunks = this.optimizeChunkSelection(transcript, criticalMoments, {
      samplingRatio: 0.3,
      qualityThreshold: 0.9,
      pmFocus: true
    })
    
    // Step 4: Hybrid analysis (cache + AI)
    const analysis = await this.hybridAnalysis(selectedChunks, userProfile)
    
    // Step 5: Quality validation and fallback
    if (analysis.confidenceScore < 0.8) {
      return this.fallbackAnalysis(transcript, userProfile)
    }
    
    return analysis
  }
  
  private async detectPMCriticalMoments(
    transcript: Transcript, 
    profile: PMProfile
  ): Promise<CriticalMoment[]> {
    const moments: CriticalMoment[] = []
    
    // Detect executive communication moments
    const executiveMoments = this.detectExecutiveHandoffs(transcript, profile.role)
    moments.push(...executiveMoments.map(m => ({ ...m, priority: 'HIGH' })))
    
    // Detect stakeholder influence attempts
    const influenceMoments = this.detectInfluenceAttempts(transcript)
    moments.push(...influenceMoments.map(m => ({ ...m, priority: 'HIGH' })))
    
    // Detect decision articulation points
    const decisionMoments = this.detectDecisionPoints(transcript)
    moments.push(...decisionMoments.map(m => ({ ...m, priority: 'MEDIUM' })))
    
    return this.rankAndFilterMoments(moments, profile.weaknessAreas)
  }
}
```

### Fallback Mechanisms

**Quality Threshold Triggers**
```typescript
interface QualityValidation {
  patternConfidence: number    // How sure we are about detected patterns
  coverageCompleteness: number // How well we covered the meeting
  pmRelevanceScore: number     // How PM-specific our analysis was
  stakeholderCoverage: number  // How well we covered all speakers
}

class QualityAssuranceService {
  validateAnalysisQuality(analysis: PMAnalysisResult): QualityValidation {
    const validation = {
      patternConfidence: this.calculatePatternConfidence(analysis),
      coverageCompleteness: this.calculateCoverage(analysis),
      pmRelevanceScore: this.calculatePMRelevance(analysis),
      stakeholderCoverage: this.calculateStakeholderCoverage(analysis)
    }
    
    // Trigger fallbacks if quality is insufficient
    if (validation.patternConfidence < 0.8) {
      return this.expandAnalysisScope(analysis, 'PATTERN_UNCERTAINTY')
    }
    
    if (validation.coverageCompleteness < 0.7) {
      return this.expandAnalysisScope(analysis, 'COVERAGE_GAPS')
    }
    
    return validation
  }
  
  private expandAnalysisScope(
    analysis: PMAnalysisResult, 
    trigger: 'PATTERN_UNCERTAINTY' | 'COVERAGE_GAPS'
  ): QualityValidation {
    // Add additional medium-priority segments for analysis
    // Increase sampling ratio from 30% to 45% for this meeting
    // Maintain cost efficiency while improving quality
  }
}
```
